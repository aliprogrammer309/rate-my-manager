                to time, at our sole discretion.
                <br />
                <br />
                Whether or not you’ve set up an account on our services, if you
                use our services we may process your personal data. We describe
                how we may use your personal data in our Privacy Policy.
                <br />
                <br />
                This includes personal data we use to offer or provide our
                services to you, our customers, other users, and the public, as
                well as to manage and improve our services.
                <br />
                <br />
                We also collect and share personal data with third-party service
                providers acting on our behalf, including providers of analytics
                services that may record or log your activities on our services,
                including text you enter, pages you visit, and features you
                interact with.
                <br />
                <br />
                By using our services, you agree to this data processing and
                sharing.
                <br />
                <br />
                We may provide you with the ability to research jobs, including
                via search functionality and through personalized ads and
                recommendations. We may also allow you to submit job
                applications via our services. We work with our affiliates to
                provide this service.
                <br />
                <br /> When you click the apply (or a similar) button to submit
                an application, your application is sent to the most appropriate
                contact information we and/or our affiliates have on file for
                that employer.
                <br />
                <br />
                While we and our affiliates endeavor to make this service the
                best it can be, employer websites and their service providers
                are not controlled by us, and we cannot guarantee that your
                application will be properly received and logged by any
                third-party employer upon transmission. If you have any reason
                to think your application was not received by an employer, we
                suggest you contact them directly to confirm.
                <br />

                Rate My O does not guarantee the identity of an employer or any
                individuals working for any employers, and therefore advises
                users to exercise caution when applying to jobs. Rate My O does
                not guarantee the validity of a job offer; users should verify
                the validity of a job offer before taking adverse action
                regarding their current employment situations. You are solely
                responsible for verifying the accuracy of any employer or job
                offer.

              <h4>4.2 Anonymity And Identity On Rate My O</h4>
              <p>
                Depending on the services you use, we may offer you different
                options for controlling how your personal data and identity are
                represented to other users, employers, and the public.
                <br />
                <br />A portion of your Profile on our community and
                conversation services is always public. Therefore, your profile
                picture, company name, title, and other general information (but
                not including your semi-/anonymous Content submissions) will be
                visible to the public and available via search.. Content
                submitted with semi-/anonymous identifiers such as your company
                name or job title is not associated with the publicly-visible
                portion of your Profile.
                <br />
                <br />
                When you submit Content such as a post, comment, or question,
                you may be able to control how you represent yourself using
                different anonymity options. For example, when using some of our
                services, you can choose to submit Content with your company
                name, your job title, or your full name.
                <br />
                <br />
                When submitting other Content, such as reviews, you may be
                required to include certain personal data for public display,
                such as your employer, job title, and/or location. In some
                groups, we may allow you to make your Profile visible to other
                members of the group so you can interact with them. <br />
                <br />
                In some instances, we may allow group leaders to limit access to
                a group and approve new group members. When you request access
                to a group, your Profile and answers to member-approval
                questions may be shared with the leader(s) for that group.
                <br />
                <br />
                We endeavor to offer opportunities to use our services while
                preserving your anonymity, However, you acknowledge that Rate My
                O cannot guarantee your anonymity as, depending on your specific
                situation and circumstances and the contents of your Content,
                even semi-/anonymous identifiers, such as company or job title,
                especially when paired with other information such as your
                location, may allow someone to identify you or narrow down your
                identity to a small group of people (e.g., employees in a
                particular department at your company). You should understand
                this risk before submitting Content to the services.
                <br />

              <h4>4.3 House Rules</h4>
              <p>
                You represent and warrant that you will use the services solely
                for lawful purposes in a manner consistent with these Terms and
                any and all applicable laws, regulations, or other legally
                enforceable obligations (including contractual obligations) you
                may have towards us and/or any third parties.
                <br />
                <br />
                You are solely responsible for your use of the services and Your
                Content.
                <br />
                <br />
                You agree that by submitting or authorizing Your Content for use
                on the services, you have reviewed,understood, and agreed to our
                Terms.
                <br />
                <br />
                You understand that you may expose yourself to liability if Your
                Content or use of the services violates applicable law or any
                third-party right.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you choose to use the services to conduct a promotion,
                including a contest or sweepstakes (“Promotion”), you alone are
                responsible for conducting the Promotion in compliance with all
                applicable laws and regulations.
                <br />
                <br />
                You and your Promotion must state that the Promotion is not
                sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Rate My O or our
                services. You acknowledge and agree that we will not assist you
                in any way with your Promotion, and you agree to conduct your
                Promotion at your own risk.
                <br />
                <br />
                We reserve the right to restrict your use of the services to
                conduct Promotions. We allow users to submit Content about their
                experiences working for employers when they have been employed
                by the employer as a full-time, part-time, contractor,
                freelancer, independent employee, or provide work that is an
                integral part of the employer’s value chain.
                <br />
                <br />
                We also allow users to submit Content regarding the staffing
                firms that place them in these roles.
                <br />
                <br />
                We consider all workers in these roles as ’employees’ with
                regard to Content submitted to Rate My O services.
                <br />
                <br />
                While we may provide the option for Rate My O users to specify
                the category of their employment when they submit Content (e.g
                contractor, freelancer), we may not consider this a requirement.
                It does not violate our Community Guidelines or these Terms for
                a worker in any one of these roles to submit Content as an
                “employee.”
                <br />
                <br />

              <p>
                You may not offer incentives in exchange for Content related to
                any company. You may not trade Content submissions with other
                employers. We will remove Content where we believe that users
                were compensated to submit Content.
                <br />
                <br />
                You may not coerce employees to submit Content. Coercion
                includes asking employees to provide proof to an employer that
                they submitted Content whether or not that proof includes the
                contents of the Content itself..

              <h4>5.3 Communications With Users </h4>
              <p>
                We may inform a user when you have taken an action with respect
                to information we or our affiliates have shared with you on
                behalf of that user, such as when you open the user’s
                application, view their resume or profile on the services (or an
                affiliate’s services), and/or make a decision about their
                application.
                <br />
                <br />
                When you view, store, or receive materials through your use of
                the services or an affiliate’s services, we may use such
                materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine our
                services and services.
                <br />
                <br />
                We may also share with our users our observations based on such
                data analysis. For example, we may tell our users which
                employers are more likely to open applications submitted via the
                services, which employers are active on the services, and how
                long on average certain aspects of the candidate process take
                for a given employer.
                <br />
                <br />
                We may send out reminder emails to users you wish to interview.
                <br />
                <br />
                We may also send emails to users on your behalf indicating that
                your job ad is potentially a match for the user’s resume or job
                preferences. You understand and agree that Rate My O may take
                such actions.
                <br />

              </p>
              <h4>5.4 Special Provisions Applicable to Advertisers </h4>
              <p>
                This provision applies to all advertisers, including employers
                who purchase or post job ads or display ads. Unless we agree
                otherwise, you may not use or otherwise process data collected
                or derived from ads (“Ad Data”) for any purpose (including
                retargeting, building or augmenting user profiles, allowing
                piggybacking or redirecting with tags, or combining with data
                across multiple advertisers’ campaigns) other than to assess the
                performance and effectiveness of your campaigns on an aggregate
                and anonymous basis.
                <br />
                <br />
                You may not, and you may not permit a third party to, transfer
                or sell any Ad Data to, or use Ad Data in connection with, any
                ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other party not acting
                on behalf of you and your campaigns.
                <br />
                <br />
                You may use information provided directly to you from users if
                you provide clear notice to and obtain applicable consent from
                those users and comply with all applicable laws and industry
                guidelines, including those applicable to data protection.

              <h3>Enforcement by Rate My O or Third Parties</h3>
              <h4>6.1 Removal of Content </h4>
              <p>
                While we have no obligation to do so, we reserve the right to
                review and remove any Content (or portion thereof) that we
                believe, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms or other
                applicable policies linked on the services (including our
                Community Guidelines), or that we deem, in our sole discretion,
                inappropriate.
                <br />
                <br /> If you see any Content on the services that you believe
                violates our policies, you may report that Content by clicking
                on an applicable report link adjacent to that Content or by
                contacting us.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once notified, we will review the Content and consider whether
                to remove it (or a portion thereof). Please note: our
                interpretation of our policies and the decision whether or not
                to remove Content is within our sole discretion.
                <br />
                <br /> You understand and agree that if we choose not to remove
                or edit Content that you find objectionable, that decision will
                not constitute a violation of these Terms or any agreement we
                have with you.

                While we have no obligation to do so, we reserve the right to
                investigate and take appropriate action in our sole discretion
                against you if you violate these Terms, including without
                limitation: removing Content (or portions thereof) from the
                services; suspending some or all of your rights to use the
                services; terminating your account(s); reporting you to law
                enforcement, regulatory authorities, or administrative bodies;

                You understand and agree that in certain circumstances we may
                disclose users’ personal data to third parties, such as when we
                are required to by law or valid legal process. You can read more
                about the specific circumstances in the “Other Instances When We
                May Disclose Your Data” section of our Privacy Policy.

                <br />
                While we have no obligation to do so, we reserve the right, to
                the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to take
                appropriate action to protect the anonymity of our users against
                the enforcement of subpoenas or other information requests that
                seek a user’s identifying information or personal data. We make
                no guarantee or representation that we will seek to protect user
                anonymity or, if we elect to do so, that we will be successful.

                a change that we believe materially reduces your rights or
                increases your responsibilities, we will notify you by
                communication (e.g., by email or text message sent to the e-mail
                address or phone number specified in your account) and/or by

                <br />
                <br />
                Subject to the exceptions to arbitration set forth in subpart
                12.2.4 below, you and Rate My O each agree that any and all
                disputes between Rate My O and consumer (i.e.,
                non-business/commercial) users arising under or related in any
                way to these Terms and/or your use of our services (and which
                are not otherwise resolved pursuant to section 12.1) must be
                resolved through binding arbitration as described in section
                12.2. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this
                agreement to arbitrate set forth in section 12.2 is
                unenforceable, the remainder of section 12 of these Terms will
                nevertheless still apply (including the prohibition on class
                arbitration).
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>12.2.2 Arbitration Procedure.</b>
                Any arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration
                Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), if
                applicable, as modified by this section. <br />
                <br />
                The AAA’s rules and a form for initiating the proceeding are
                available at www.adr.org. Any settlement offer made by you or
                Rate My O shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. <br />
                <br />
                Unless otherwise required by the applicable arbitration rules,
                the arbitration shall be held in Oxnard, California. <br />
                <br />
                For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is
                $10,000 or less, you and Rate My O must have the arbitration
                conducted by audio and/or a video communication system
                (including, but not limited to telephone conference or a video
                conference platform such as Zoom) or based solely on written
                submissions, which shall be binding on you and Rate My O subject
                to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you or Rate My O
                may attend by audio and/or a video communication system
                (including, but not limited to telephone conference or a video
                conference platform such as Zoom), unless the arbitrator
                requires otherwise. <br />
                <br />
                The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in
                accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles
                of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by
                law. <br />
                <br />
                The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior
                arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings
                in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent
                required by applicable law. <br />
                <br />
                The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment
                on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
                court having jurisdiction thereof. <br />

              <h4>12.3 Opt-Out Procedure</h4>
              <p>
                IF YOU ARE A NEW USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT
                TO ARBITRATE (“OPT-OUT”) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE
                (“OPT-OUT NOTICE”). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO
                LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS FOR THE
                FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO Rate My O, via
                our email: main@ratemyo.com <br />
                <br />
                For your convenience, we are providing an Opt-Out Notice form
                that you may use. Please make sure to include your name, and the
                email address(es) associated with the account(s) to which the
                opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be
                effective. <br />
                <br />
                This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement
                to arbitrate set forth in section 12.2. If you opt out of the
                agreement to arbitrate set forth in this section, all other
                parts of these Terms and Section 12 will continue to apply to
                you. <br />
                <br />
                Opting out of the agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any
                previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may
                enter into or have entered into with us. <br />

                  a final resolution of the arbitration, at which point the
